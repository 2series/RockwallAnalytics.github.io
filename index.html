By envisioning our work as Rockwall Analytics, we can shift the focus of our experimentation away from replication towards a more rewarding aim: empowering individuals, in all their cognitive and behavioural diversity, to make better decisions based on their own data and preferences. We have already seen this approach bearing fruit commercially, especially for innovative players in the tech sector, and we expect this to be widely emulated. Any firm seeking to fully use the individual-level data it holds will benefit from developing a combined behavioural and data science methodology</p></div>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Every year financial institutions are spending billions against fraud detection applications, as it may hurt the company’s brand and reputation. Data science plays a key role in collecting, summarizing, and predicting the customer database to detect fraudulent activities. Analysis of customer records to drive accurate information is not possible before the existence of data science/big data. Ai and ML can help banks combat fraudulent activities. For example, data models can be built for analyzing credit card frauds that provide data intelligence and classify legit or fraudulent transactions, based on details like purchase amount, location, merchant, time and other parameters</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">To dive into the challenges and obstacles of this project, we got a quote from a Machine Learning Engineer from our development team: The most complicated part of the solution was to achieve good metrics for users who have made only a few transactions. We could apply the regular model, which is good for users with a rich transaction history, but it would give worse scores if there is a lack of historical data (for example, a new user). Another obvious solution is to treat such users as empty accounts that have only identity information without any transaction history. In this case, we lose the advantage of having at least some data about the users, but the results that such a model provides are quite stable (underfitting). After making a weekly stand up on the matter, we decided to look into ‘few-shot learning’ techniques, which could help us improve our metrics. We have prepared a PoC, but it didn’t give us the drastic improvement we had expected. Nevertheless, we proceeded with experimenting and diving into our ClientX's business domain; it allowed us to develop features which have made a huge impact on our model that is based on ‘few-shot learning’ techniques. Because of the domain features, our main score improved by more than 15% and it became the production solution</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Financial distress is a term used in the corporate finance world that refers to a situation of a company when the financial promises to its creditors are either broken or are honored with much difficulty. There could be many factors responsible for a company to be financially distressed – poor budgeting, constant losses, inability to break even, etc. The ability of the company to identify such reasons in advance will enable it to draft preventive measures and strategies to save itself from the distress. To safeguard the company as well as the vested interests of various stakeholders involved, predicting the early warning indicators of financial distress is a crucial element. By leveraging Ai, Data Science, and Machine Learning, we analyzed the factors and predicted the major factors that affect the financial strength of the company</p>

The key to success in marketing is to customize an offer that suits particular customer preferences and need. Data science in retail can help create a personalized window for every customer, by dividing the data into demographical, geographical and historical data sets. These datasets provide deeper insights regarding how a customer responses to an offer/promotion. Therefore, Ai can make personalized outreach to interact with customers. Machine learning helps in creating powerful recommendation engines that can create upsell/cross-sell opportunities for sellers</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Analytics, Health, and Clinical Data</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The healthcare industry is one of the biggest producers of data. In fact, the average healthcare provider is sitting on nearly 9 petabytes of medical data. The rise of electronic health records (EHR), digital medical imagery, and wearables are contributing to this data explosion. For instance, an EHR system at a large provider can catalogue millions of medical tests, clinical interactions, and prescribed treatments. And the potential to learn from this population scale data is massive. By building analytic dashboards and machine learning models on top of these datasets, healthcare providers can improve the patient experience and drive better health outcomes</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Despite the opportunity to improve patient care with analytics and machine learning, healthcare providers face the classical big data challenges:</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">- Variety. The delivery of care produces a lot of multidimensional data from a variety of data sources. Healthcare workers need to run queries across patients, treatments, facilities and time windows to build a holistic view of the patient experience. This is compute intensive for legacy analytics platforms. On top of that, 80% of healthcare data is unstructured (e.g. clinical notes, medical imaging, genomics, etc). Unfortunately, traditional data warehouses, which serve as the analytics backbone for most healthcare providers, don’t support unstructured data</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">- Volume. Some providers have started investing in health data lakes to bring their petabytes of structured and unstructured data together. Unfortunately, traditional query engines struggle with data volumes of this magnitude. A simple ad-hoc analysis can take hours or days. This is too long to wait when adjusting for patient needs in real-time</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">- Velocity. Patients are always coming into the clinic or hospital. With a constant flow of data, EHR records may need to be updated to fix coding errors. It’s critical that a transactional model exists to allow for updates</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">As if this wasn’t challenging enough, the data store must also support data scientists who need to run ad-hoc transformations, like creating a longitudinal view of a patient, or build predictive insights with machine learning techniques</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Fortunately, Delta Lake, an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to big data workloads, along with Apache Spark can help solve these challenges by providing a transactional store that supports fast multidimensional queries on diverse data along with rich data science capabilities. With Delta Lake and Apache Spark, healthcare providers can build a scalable clinical data lake for analytics and machine learning</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">We’ll start by walking through a simple example showing how Delta Lake can be used for ad-hoc analytics on health and clinical data. In future blogs, we'll look at how Delta Lake and Spark can be coupled together to process streaming HL7/FHIR datasets. Finally, we will look at a number of data science use cases that can run on top of a health data lake built with Delta Lake</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">To illustrate how Delta Lake makes it easier to work with large clinical datasets, we'll start off with a simple but powerful use case. We will build a dashboard that allows us to identify comorbid conditions (one or more diseases or conditions that occur along with another condition in the same person at the same time) across a population of patients. To do this, we will use a simulated EHR dataset, generated by the Synthea simulator, made available through Databricks Datasets (AWS | Azure). This dataset represents a cohort of approximately 11,000 patients from Massachusetts, and is stored in 12 CSV files. We will load the CSV files in, before masking protected health information (PHI) and joining the tables together to get the data representation we need for our downstream query. Once the data has been refined, we will use SparkR to build a dashboard that allows us to interactively explore and compute common health statistics on our dataset</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.1-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">This use case is a very common starting point. In a clinical setting, we may look at comorbidities as a way to understand the risk of a patient’s disease increasing in severity. From a medical coding and financial perspective, looking at comorbid diseases may allow us to identify common medical coding issues that impact reimbursement. In pharmaceutical research, looking at comorbid diseases with shared genetic evidence may give us a deeper understanding of the function of a gene</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">However, when we think about the underlying analytics architecture, we are also at a starting point. Instead of loading data in one large batch, we might seek to load streaming EHR data to allow for real-time analytics. Instead of using a dashboard that gives us simple insights, we may advance to machine learning use cases, such as training a model that uses data from recent patient encounters to predict the progression of a disease. This can be powerful in an ER setting where streaming data and Ai can be used to predict the likelihood of a patient improving or declining in real-time</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">In the rest of this blog, we'll walk through the implementation of our dashboard. We will first start by using Apache Spark and Delta Lake to ETL our simulated EHR dataset. Once the data has been prepared for analysis, we will then create a notebook that identifies comorbid conditions in our dataset. By using built-in capabilities in Databricks (AWS | Azure), we can then directly transform the notebook into a dashboard</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">To start off, we need to load our CSV data dump into a consistent representation that we can use for our analytical workloads. By using Delta Lake, we can accelerate a number of the downstream queries that we will run. Delta Lake supports Z-ordering, which allows us to efficiently query data across multiple dimensions. This is critical for working with EHR data, as we may want to slice and dice our data by patient, by date, by care facility, or by condition, amongst other things. Additionally, the managed Delta Lake offering in Databricks provides additional optimizations, which accelerate exploratory queries into our dataset. Delta Lake also future-proofs our work: while we aren’t currently working with streaming data, we may work with live streams from an EHR system in the future, and Delta Lake’s ACID semantics (AWS | Azure) make working with streams simple and reliable</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Our workflow follows a few steps that we show in the figure below. We will start by loading the raw data from our eight different CSV files, we will mask any PHI that is present in the tables, and we will write out a set of silver tables. We will then join our silver tables together to get an easier representation to work with for downstream queries</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Loading our raw CSV files into Delta Lake tables is a straightforward process. Apache Spark has native support for loading CSV, and we are able to load our files with a single line of code per file. While Spark does not have inbuilt support for masking PHI, we can use Spark’s rich support for user defined functions (UDFs, AWS | Azure) to define an arbitrary function that deterministically masks fields with PHI or PII. In our example notebook, we use a Python function to compute a SHA1 hash. Finally, saving the data into Delta Lake is a single line of code</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.2-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Once data has been loaded into Delta, we can optimize the tables by running a simple SQL command. In our example comorbid condition prediction engine, we will want to rapidly query across both the patient ID and the condition they were evaluated for. By using Delta Lake’s Z-ordering command, we can optimize the table so it can be rapidly queried down either dimension. We have done this on one of our final gold tables, which has joined several of our silver tables together to achieve the data representation we will need for our dashboard</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted"></p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.3-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Now that we've prepared our dataset, we'll build our dashboard allowing us to explore comorbid conditions, or more simply put, conditions that commonly co-occur in a single patient. Some of the time, these can be precursors/risk factors, for example, high blood pressure is a well known risk factor for stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. By discovering and monitoring comorbid conditions, and other health statistics, we can improve care by identifying risks and advising patients on preventative steps they can take. Ultimately, identifying comorbidities is a counting exercise! We need to identify the distinct set of patients who had both condition A and condition B, which means it can be done all fully in SQL using Spark SQL. In our dashboard, we will follow a simple three step process</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">First, we create a dataframe that has conditions, ranked by the number of patients they occurred in. This allows the user to visualize the relative frequency of the most common conditions in their dataset</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.4-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">We then give the user widgets (AWS | Azure) to specify 2 conditions they are interested in comparing. By using Spark SQL, we identify the full set of patients that the condition occurred in</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.5-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Since we do this in Spark SQL using SparkR, we can easily collect the count of patients at the end and use a χ2 test to compute significance. We print whether or not the association between the 2 conditions are statistically significant</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted"> While a data scientist who is rapidly iterating to understand what trends lie in their dataset may be happy working in a notebook, we'll encounter a number of users (clinicians, public health officials and researchers, operations analysts, billing analysts) who are less interested in seeing the code underlying the analysis. By using the built-in dashboarding function, we can hide the code and focus on the visualizations we’ve generated. Since we added widgets into our notebook, our users can still provide input to the notebook and change which diseases to compare</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.6-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">In conclusion, we laid down the fundamentals for building a scalable health data lake with Delta Lake and a simple comorbidity dashboard. To learn more about analyzing real world data at scale</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Ai Modlel Creation</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">How does a firm create Ai models? What is the process? Well, as should be no surprise, it is complex and susceptible to failure</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">But then again, there are some key principles to keep in mind. So let’s take a look:</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/014-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">SELECTION: There are hundreds of algorithms to choose from. In some cases, the best technique is to use several (this is known as ensemble modelling)</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">You need to determine the core task, said Safiya, who is a computer scientist at the Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI International. “What are you trying to accomplish? Suppose you have a bunch of images which you want to classify. The model adopted would be dramatically different from a case where you want to put captions on the images, even if they look similar and have the same input data”</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">It’s crucial to realize that you need the right kind of data for certain models. If anything, this is one of the biggest challenges in the Ai development process. “On average, the data preparation process takes 2X or in some cases 3X longer that just the design of the algorithm,” said Rihad, who is the Lead Data Scientist at Rockwall Analytics</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">So in the early phases of a project, you need to get a good sense of the data. “Conduct an exploratory analysis,” said Safiya, “visualize the data in 2-dimensions and 3-dimensions, then run simple, descriptive statistics to understand the data more effectively. Next, check for anomalies and missing data. Then clean the data to get a better picture of the sample size”</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">But there is no perfect model, as there will always be trade-offs</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">"There is an old theorem in the machine learning and pattern recognition community called the No Free Lunch Theorem, which states that there is no single model that is best on all tasks," said Rihad. So, understanding the relationships between the assumptions a model makes and the assumptions a task makes is key</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">TRAINING: Once you have an algorithm, or a set of them, you want to perform tests against the dataset. The best practice is to divide the dataset into at least 2 parts. About 70% to 80% is for training and tuning of the model. The remaining will then be used for validation. Through this process, there will be a look at the accuracy rates</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The good news is that there are many Ai platforms that can help streamline the process. There are open source offerings, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, KNIME, Anaconda and Keras, as well as proprietary applications like Alteryx, Databricks, DataRobot, MathWorks and SAS. And of course, there are rich Ai systems from Amazon, Microsoft and Google</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">"The key is to look for open source tools which allow for easy and quick experimentation,” said Rihad. “If you prefer to purchase 3rd party solutions, there are many ISVs offering Ai-based solutions for tasks like image recognition, chat bots, defect detection and so on”</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">FEATURE ENGINEERIN: This is the process of finding the variables that are the best predictors for a model. This is where the expertise of a data scientist is essential. But there is also often a need to have domain experts help out</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">“To perform feature engineering, the practitioner building the model is required to have a good understanding of the problem at hand—such as having a preconceived notion of possible effective predictors even before discovering them through the data,” said Safiya. “For example, in the case of predicting defaults for loan applicants, an effective predictor could be monthly income flow from the applicant”</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">But finding the right features can be nearly impossible in some situations. This could be the case with computer vision, such as when used with autonomous vehicles. Yet using sophisticated deep learning can be a solution</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">“These days, neural networks are used to learn features, as they are better at understanding statistics than humans,” said Rihad. “However, they are not necessarily a panacea and might develop features that were not intended as well. The famous example is the image classifier which was developed to detect tanks and jeeps. Instead, it learned to detect night and day since all jeep photos were taken in the day and all tank photos were taken in the museum at night”</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Ai Model Bias</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Why are Artificial Intelligence systems biased?</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">An Ai system used to assess recidivism risks in Broward County, Fla., often gave higher risk scores to African Americans than to whites, even when the latter had criminal records. The popular sentence-completion facility in Google Mail was caught assuming that an “investor” must be a male</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/015-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">A celebrated natural language generator called GPT, with an uncanny ability to write polished-looking essays for any prompt, produced seemingly racist and sexist completions when given prompts about minorities. Amazon found, to its consternation, that an automated Ai-based hiring system it built didn’t seem to like female candidates</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Commercial gender-recognition systems put out by industrial heavy-weights, including Amazon, IBM and Microsoft, have been shown to suffer from high misrecognition rates for people of color. Another commercial face-recognition technology that Amazon tried to sell to government agencies has been shown to have significantly higher error rates for minorities. And a popular selfie lens by Snapchat appears to “whiten” people’s faces, apparently to make them more attractive</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">These are not just academic curiosities. Broward County’s recidivism system, while supposedly only one of several factors judges were to consider, was shown to have a substantial impact. Just recently, we learned of the first false arrest of an African American based largely on a facial-recognition system</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Even as these embedded biases are discovered, new ones come up</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Perhaps the most egregious are what may be called “mugshot Ai,” which claims to unearth useful patterns from physiognomic characteristics. From phrenology to palmistry, pseudosciences that claim to tell personality and mental states from physical characteristics are nothing new. Ai’s newfound ability to process, recognize or find patterns from large-scale physiognomic data has, however, given a dubious new lease to these dubious undertakings. Various firms claim to discern personality characteristics, including criminality, from mugshots or to speed up recruitment by analyzing job candidates from online video interviews. Indeed, there is a tremendous temptation to look for some arbitrary correlational mapping from one high-dimensional object — a person’s face, voice, posture — to another critical decision variable, given enough data</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Of course, bias existed before the advent of Ai systems. Human decision-makers, from law enforcement to employment agencies, have been known to act on internal biases. One saving grace is that there is variance in individual human biases, which works to reduce their macro harm; not all humans have the same difficulty in distinguishing between non-white faces, for example</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Yet, bias internalized in a widely deployed Ai system can be insidious — precisely because a single set of biases become institutionalized with little variance</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The situation is further exacerbated by our well-known automation bias, which makes us subconsciously give greater weight to machine decisions</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Reining in inadvertent amplification of societal biases thus has become one of the most urgent tasks in managing the risks of data-driven Ai technology</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">So why do Ai systems exhibit racist or sexist biases? Are people in commercial Ai labs deliberately writing biased algorithms or training systems on deliberately biased data? Turns out that the offending behavior is most often learned than designed, and most of these systems have been trained on readily available public data, often gleaned from the web</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">A critical catalyst for the recent successes of Ai has been the automatically captured digital footprints of our lives and quotidian interactions. This allowed image-recognition systems to be trained on troves of pictures (often with labels) that we collectively upload onto the web, and natural language systems to be trained on the enormous body of language captured on the web — from Reddit to Wikipedia — through our daily interactions</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Indeed, the web and internet have become a repository of our Jungian collective subconscious — and a convenient way to train Ai. A problem with the collective subconscious is that it is often raw, unwashed and rife with prejudices; an Ai system trained on it, not surprisingly, winds up learning these and, when deployed at scale, can unwittingly exacerbate existing biases</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">In other words, although it is no longer socially acceptable to admit to racist or sexist views, such views — and their consequences — often are still implicit in our collective behavior and captured in our digital footprints. Modern data-driven Ai systems can unwittingly learn these biases, even if we didn’t quite intend them to</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Ai trained on such biased data not only are used in predictive decision-making (policing, job interviews, etc.), but also to generate or finish incompletely specified data (e.g., to improve a low-resolution picture by upsampling it). This generation phase can itself be a vehicle for further propagation of biases. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, for example, that a system trained on images of engineering faculty members will more readily imagine a male face than a female one. The fact that machine learning models are limited to capturing correlational patterns in the data — and that some correlations may result from ingrained inequitable societal structures — means societal biases can seep in, despite well-intentioned design</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Increasingly, designers are combating societal biases in Ai systems. First and foremost is curating the training data. Unlike traditional disciplines, like statistics, that paid significant attention to data collection strategies, progress in Ai came mostly from exploiting the copious data available on the web. Unfortunately, that readily available data often is asymmetric and doesn’t have sufficient diversity — Western societies, for example, tend to have a larger digital footprint than others. Such asymmetries, in turn, lead to the kinds of asymmetric failures observed in gender-detection systems. Some obvious ideas for curation, such as “blinding” the learning system to certain sensitive attributes such as gender and race, have been shown to be of limited effectiveness</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The other issue of using readily available data is that it is often rife with hidden biases. For example, as much as there is temptation to train large-scale language generation systems on the profusion of text on the web, it is not surprising that a lot of this user-generated text on forums that allow anonymous postings can be rife with biases. This explains to a large extent the types of biased text completions observed in some state-of-the-art language-generation systems. There is a growing understanding that training data must be carefully vetted. Such steps may increase the costs of — and severely reduce — the data available for training. Nevertheless, given the insidious societal costs of using uncurated data, we must be ready to bear those costs</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Some also have advocated explicitly “de-biasing” the data (e.g., by balancing the classes in the training samples). While a tempting solution, such steps in essence correspond to a form of social engineering — in this case, of data. If there is social engineering to be done, it seems much better for society to do it at the societal level, rather than just by Ai developers</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Part of the challenge in controlling harmful societal biases in today’s Ai systems is that most of them are largely data-driven, and typically do not take any explicit knowledge as input. Given that explicit knowledge is often the most natural way to state societal norms and mores, there are efforts to effectively infuse explicit knowledge into data-driven predictive systems</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Another proactive step is looking more carefully at what is being optimized by learning systems. Most systems focus on optimizing the accuracy of a predictive system. It is, however, possible for a system that had high overall accuracy to still have bad performance on certain minority classes. More generally, there is increasing recognition that the degree of egregiousness in misclassifications must be considered — after all, confusing apples with oranges is less egregious than confusing humans with animals. The prohibitive costs of false positives in some applications (e.g., face recognition in predictive policing) might caution a civilized society that, in some cases, predictive systems based on correlational patterns should be avoided, despite their seemingly high accuracy</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">As Ai technology matures and becomes widely deployed, there is increased awareness — in the research community, companies, governments and society — of the importance of considering its impacts. There are now premier academic conferences devoted to scholarly understanding of the impact of Ai in exacerbating societal biases; increasingly, Ai publications ask for an explicit discussion of the broader impacts of technical work. Alerted by ongoing research, companies such as IBM, Amazon and Microsoft are declaring moratoriums on the sale of technologies such as face recognition, pending greater understanding of their impacts. Several U.S. cities have banned or suspended facial-recognition technology in policing</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">There is, of course, no magic bullet for removing societal bias from Ai systems. The only way to make sure fair learning can happen from the digital traces of our lives is to actually lead fair lives, however tall an order that might be</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">But we also should acknowledge that these systems, rightly used, can hold a mirror up to society. Just as television brought racial injustices into our living rooms during the 1960s’ civil rights movement and helped change us for the better, Ai systems based on our digital footprints can help show us ourselves and, thus, be a force for our betterment</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">A Convolutional Neural Network Implementation For Car Classification</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are state-of-the-art neural network architectures that are primarily used for computer vision applications. CNN can be applied to a number of different tasks, such as image recognition, object localization, and change detection. Rockwall Analytics challenge: Develop a Computer Vision application which could identify the car model in a given image. Considering that different car models can appear quite similar and any car can look very different depending on their surroundings and the angle at which they are photographed, such a task was, until quite recently, simply impossible</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/016-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">However, starting around 2012, the ‘Deep Learning Revolution’ made it possible to handle such a problem. Instead of being explained the concept of a car, computers could instead repeatedly study pictures and learn such concepts themselves. In the past few years, additional Artificial Neural Network innovations have resulted in Ai that can perform image classification tasks with human-level accuracy. Building on such developments we were able to train a Deep CNN to classify cars by their model. The neural network was trained on the Stanford Cars dataset, which contains over 16,000 images of cars, comprising 196 different models. Over time we could see the accuracy of predictions began to improve, as the neural network learned the concept of a car, and how to distinguish between different models</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Together with our partner we build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Apache Spark™ and Koalas for the data preprocessing, Keras with Tensorflow for the model training, MLflow for the tracking of models and results, and Azure ML for the deployment of a REST service. This setup within Azure Databricks is optimized to train networks fast and efficiently, and also helps to try many different CNN configurations much more quickly. Even after only a few practice attempts, the CNN’s accuracy reached around 85%</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/016.1-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Setting up an Artificial Neural Network to Classify Images</h4>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">In this article we are outlining some of the main approaches used in getting a neural network up into production. If you’d like to attempt to get the neural network running yourself, the full notebooks with a meticulous step-by-step guide included, can be found below</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">This use case uses the publicly available Stanford Cars Dataset which is one of the more comprehensive public datasets, although a little outdated, so you won’t find car models post 2012 (although, once trained, transfer learning could easily allow a new dataset to be substituted). The data is provided through an ADLS Gen2 storage account that you can mount to your workspace</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/016.2-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The first step of data preprocessing the images are compressed into hdf5 files (one for training and one for testing). This can then be read in by the neural network. This step can be omitted completely, if you like, as the hdf5 files are part of the ADLS Gen2 storage provided as part of the here provided notebooks</p>
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Image Augmentation with Koalas</h4>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The quantity and diversity of data gathered has a large impact on the results one can achieve with deep learning models. Data augmentation is a strategy that can significantly improve learning results without the need to actually collect new data. With different techniques like cropping, padding, and horizontal flipping, which are commonly used to train large neural networks, the datasets can be artificially inflated by increasing the number of images for training and testing</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/016.3-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Applying augmentation to a large corpus of training data can be very expensive, especially when comparing the results of different approaches. With Koalas it becomes easy to try existing frameworks for image augmentation in Python, and scaling the process out on a cluster with multiple nodes using the data science familiar Pandas API</p>
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Coding a ResNet in Keras</h4>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">When you break apart a CNN, they comprise different ‘blocks’, with each block simply representing a group of operations to be applied to some input data. These blocks can be broadly categorized into:</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">IDENTITY BLOCK: A series of operations which keep the shape of the data the same</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">CONVOLUTION BLOCK: A series of operations which reduce the shape of the input data to a smaller shape</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">A CNN is a series of both Identity Blocks and Convolution Blocks (or ConvBlocks) which reduce an input image to a compact group of numbers. Each of these resulting numbers (if trained correctly) should eventually tell you something useful towards classifying the image. A Residual CNN adds an additional step for each block. The data is saved as a temporary variable before the operations that constitute the block are applied, and then this temporary data is added to the output data. Generally, this additional step is applied to each block. As an example the below figure demonstrates a simplified CNN for detecting handwritten numbers</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/016.4-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">There are many different techniques of implementing a neural network. One of the more intuitive ways is via Keras. Keras provides a simple front-end library for executing the individual steps which comprise a neural network. Keras can be configured to work with a Tensorflow back-end, or a Theano back-end. Here, we'll be using a Tensorflow back-end. A Keras network is broken up into multiple layers as seen below. For our network we are also defining our customer implementation of a layer</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/016.5-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">The Scale Layer</h4>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">For any custom operation that has trainable weights Keras allows you to implement your own layer. When dealing with huge amounts of image data, one can run into memory issues. Initially, RGB images contain integer data (0-255). When running gradient descent as part of the optimisation during backpropagation, one will find that integer gradients do not allow for sufficient accuracy to properly adjust network weights. Therefore, it's necessary to change to float precision. This is where issues can arise. Even when images are scaled down to 224x224x3, when we use ten thousand training images, we are looking at over 1 billion floating point entries. As opposed to turning an entire dataset to float precision, better practice is to use a ‘Scale Layer’, which scales the input data one image at a time, and only when it is needed. This should be applied after Batch Normalization in the model. The parameters of this Scale Layer are also parameters that can be learned through training</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">To use this custom layer also during scoring we have to package the class together with our model. With MLflow we can achieve this with a Keras custom_objects dictionary mapping names (strings) to custom classes or functions associated with the Keras model. MLflow saves these custom layers using CloudPickle and restores them automatically when the model is loaded with mlflow.keras.load_model() and mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()</p>
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Tracking Results with MLflow & Azure ML</h4>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Ai development involves additional complexities beyond software development. That there are a myriad of tools and frameworks makes it hard to track experiments, reproduce results and deploy machine learning models. Together with Azure ML one can accelerate and manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle using MLflow to reliably build, share and deploy machine learning applications</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">In order to automatically track results, an existing or new Azure ML workspace can be linked to your Azure Databricks workspace. Additionally, MLflow supports auto-logging for Keras models (mlflow.keras.autolog()), making the experience almost effortless</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">While MLflow’s built-in model persistence utilities are convenient for packaging models from various popular ML libraries such as Keras, they do not cover every use case. For example, you may want to use a model from an ML library that is not explicitly supported by MLflow’s built-in flavours. Alternatively, you may want to package custom inference code and data to create an MLflow Model. Fortunately, MLflow provides 2 solutions that can be used to accomplish these tasks: Custom Python Models and Custom Flavors</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">In this scenario we want to make sure we can use a model inference engine that supports serving requests from a REST API client. For this we are using a custom model based on the previously built Keras model to accept a JSON Dataframe object that has a Base64-encoded image inside</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">In the next step we can use this py_model and deploy it to an Azure Container Instances server which can be achieved through MLflow’s Azure ML integration</p>
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Deploy an Image Classification Model in Azure Container Instances</h4>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">By now we have a trained model, and have registered a model in our workspace with MLflow in the cloud. As a final step we would like to deploy the model as a web service on Azure Container Instances</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">A web service is an image, in this case a Docker image. It encapsulates the scoring logic and the model itself. In this case we are using our custom MLflow model representation which gives us control over how the scoring logic takes in car images from a REST client and how the response is shaped</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Container Instances is a great solution for testing and understanding the workflow. For scalable production deployments, consider using Azure Kubernetes Service</p>
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Conclusion</h4>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">This use case and notebooks demonstrate the main techniques used in setting up an end-to-end workflow training and deploying a neural network in production on Azure. The exercises of the linked notebook will walk you through the required steps of creating this inside your own Azure Databricks environment using tools like Keras, Databricks Koalas, MLflow, and Azure ML</p>
