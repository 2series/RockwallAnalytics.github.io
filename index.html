By envisioning our work as Rockwall Analytics, we can shift the focus of our experimentation away from replication towards a more rewarding aim: empowering individuals, in all their cognitive and behavioural diversity, to make better decisions based on their own data and preferences. We have already seen this approach bearing fruit commercially, especially for innovative players in the tech sector, and we expect this to be widely emulated. Any firm seeking to fully use the individual-level data it holds will benefit from developing a combined behavioural and data science methodology</p></div>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Every year financial institutions are spending billions against fraud detection applications, as it may hurt the company’s brand and reputation. Data science plays a key role in collecting, summarizing, and predicting the customer database to detect fraudulent activities. Analysis of customer records to drive accurate information is not possible before the existence of data science/big data. Ai and ML can help banks combat fraudulent activities. For example, data models can be built for analyzing credit card frauds that provide data intelligence and classify legit or fraudulent transactions, based on details like purchase amount, location, merchant, time and other parameters</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">To dive into the challenges and obstacles of this project, we got a quote from a Machine Learning Engineer from our development team: The most complicated part of the solution was to achieve good metrics for users who have made only a few transactions. We could apply the regular model, which is good for users with a rich transaction history, but it would give worse scores if there is a lack of historical data (for example, a new user). Another obvious solution is to treat such users as empty accounts that have only identity information without any transaction history. In this case, we lose the advantage of having at least some data about the users, but the results that such a model provides are quite stable (underfitting). After making a weekly stand up on the matter, we decided to look into ‘few-shot learning’ techniques, which could help us improve our metrics. We have prepared a PoC, but it didn’t give us the drastic improvement we had expected. Nevertheless, we proceeded with experimenting and diving into our ClientX's business domain; it allowed us to develop features which have made a huge impact on our model that is based on ‘few-shot learning’ techniques. Because of the domain features, our main score improved by more than 15% and it became the production solution</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Financial distress is a term used in the corporate finance world that refers to a situation of a company when the financial promises to its creditors are either broken or are honored with much difficulty. There could be many factors responsible for a company to be financially distressed – poor budgeting, constant losses, inability to break even, etc. The ability of the company to identify such reasons in advance will enable it to draft preventive measures and strategies to save itself from the distress. To safeguard the company as well as the vested interests of various stakeholders involved, predicting the early warning indicators of financial distress is a crucial element. By leveraging Ai, Data Science, and Machine Learning, we analyzed the factors and predicted the major factors that affect the financial strength of the company</p>

As claims data and fraudulent activity related to it is constantly being processed, it is best to view this as a fraud detection process that operates with constancy against the evolving claims activity. In the past, Data Analysis happened in a series of queries meant to investigate suspicious activity as human observation identified patterns in the data that indicate possible fraud. Ideally, state of the art Data Science and engineering can be combined to create a data machine that can continually evaluate the data for fraud indicators</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Now, with so much feedback, if you’re not analyzing customer data to extract actionable data intelligence then you’re missing an excellent way to understand your customer at a deeper level. Understanding your customer, (s)he motivations and concerns, can help you pinpoint and solve a lot of your banking problems, sharpen your marketing strategy, and improve your product or service offerings</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Analytics, Health, and Clinical Data</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The healthcare industry is one of the biggest producers of data. In fact, the average healthcare provider is sitting on nearly 9 petabytes of medical data. The rise of electronic health records (EHR), digital medical imagery, and wearables are contributing to this data explosion. For instance, an EHR system at a large provider can catalogue millions of medical tests, clinical interactions, and prescribed treatments. And the potential to learn from this population scale data is massive. By building analytic dashboards and machine learning models on top of these datasets, healthcare providers can improve the patient experience and drive better health outcomes</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Despite the opportunity to improve patient care with analytics and machine learning, healthcare providers face the classical big data challenges:</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">- Variety. The delivery of care produces a lot of multidimensional data from a variety of data sources. Healthcare workers need to run queries across patients, treatments, facilities and time windows to build a holistic view of the patient experience. This is compute intensive for legacy analytics platforms. On top of that, 80% of healthcare data is unstructured (e.g. clinical notes, medical imaging, genomics, etc). Unfortunately, traditional data warehouses, which serve as the analytics backbone for most healthcare providers, don’t support unstructured data</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">- Volume. Some providers have started investing in health data lakes to bring their petabytes of structured and unstructured data together. Unfortunately, traditional query engines struggle with data volumes of this magnitude. A simple ad-hoc analysis can take hours or days. This is too long to wait when adjusting for patient needs in real-time</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">- Velocity. Patients are always coming into the clinic or hospital. With a constant flow of data, EHR records may need to be updated to fix coding errors. It’s critical that a transactional model exists to allow for updates</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">As if this wasn’t challenging enough, the data store must also support data scientists who need to run ad-hoc transformations, like creating a longitudinal view of a patient, or build predictive insights with machine learning techniques</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Fortunately, Delta Lake, an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to big data workloads, along with Apache Spark can help solve these challenges by providing a transactional store that supports fast multidimensional queries on diverse data along with rich data science capabilities. With Delta Lake and Apache Spark, healthcare providers can build a scalable clinical data lake for analytics and machine learning</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">We’ll start by walking through a simple example showing how Delta Lake can be used for ad-hoc analytics on health and clinical data. In future blogs, we'll look at how Delta Lake and Spark can be coupled together to process streaming HL7/FHIR datasets. Finally, we will look at a number of data science use cases that can run on top of a health data lake built with Delta Lake</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">To illustrate how Delta Lake makes it easier to work with large clinical datasets, we'll start off with a simple but powerful use case. We will build a dashboard that allows us to identify comorbid conditions (one or more diseases or conditions that occur along with another condition in the same person at the same time) across a population of patients. To do this, we will use a simulated EHR dataset, generated by the Synthea simulator, made available through Databricks Datasets (AWS | Azure). This dataset represents a cohort of approximately 11,000 patients from Massachusetts, and is stored in 12 CSV files. We will load the CSV files in, before masking protected health information (PHI) and joining the tables together to get the data representation we need for our downstream query. Once the data has been refined, we will use SparkR to build a dashboard that allows us to interactively explore and compute common health statistics on our dataset</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.1-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">This use case is a very common starting point. In a clinical setting, we may look at comorbidities as a way to understand the risk of a patient’s disease increasing in severity. From a medical coding and financial perspective, looking at comorbid diseases may allow us to identify common medical coding issues that impact reimbursement. In pharmaceutical research, looking at comorbid diseases with shared genetic evidence may give us a deeper understanding of the function of a gene</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">However, when we think about the underlying analytics architecture, we are also at a starting point. Instead of loading data in one large batch, we might seek to load streaming EHR data to allow for real-time analytics. Instead of using a dashboard that gives us simple insights, we may advance to machine learning use cases, such as training a model that uses data from recent patient encounters to predict the progression of a disease. This can be powerful in an ER setting where streaming data and Ai can be used to predict the likelihood of a patient improving or declining in real-time</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">In the rest of this blog, we'll walk through the implementation of our dashboard. We will first start by using Apache Spark and Delta Lake to ETL our simulated EHR dataset. Once the data has been prepared for analysis, we will then create a notebook that identifies comorbid conditions in our dataset. By using built-in capabilities in Databricks (AWS | Azure), we can then directly transform the notebook into a dashboard</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">To start off, we need to load our CSV data dump into a consistent representation that we can use for our analytical workloads. By using Delta Lake, we can accelerate a number of the downstream queries that we will run. Delta Lake supports Z-ordering, which allows us to efficiently query data across multiple dimensions. This is critical for working with EHR data, as we may want to slice and dice our data by patient, by date, by care facility, or by condition, amongst other things. Additionally, the managed Delta Lake offering in Databricks provides additional optimizations, which accelerate exploratory queries into our dataset. Delta Lake also future-proofs our work: while we aren’t currently working with streaming data, we may work with live streams from an EHR system in the future, and Delta Lake’s ACID semantics (AWS | Azure) make working with streams simple and reliable</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Our workflow follows a few steps that we show in the figure below. We will start by loading the raw data from our eight different CSV files, we will mask any PHI that is present in the tables, and we will write out a set of silver tables. We will then join our silver tables together to get an easier representation to work with for downstream queries</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Loading our raw CSV files into Delta Lake tables is a straightforward process. Apache Spark has native support for loading CSV, and we are able to load our files with a single line of code per file. While Spark does not have inbuilt support for masking PHI, we can use Spark’s rich support for user defined functions (UDFs, AWS | Azure) to define an arbitrary function that deterministically masks fields with PHI or PII. In our example notebook, we use a Python function to compute a SHA1 hash. Finally, saving the data into Delta Lake is a single line of code</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.2-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Once data has been loaded into Delta, we can optimize the tables by running a simple SQL command. In our example comorbid condition prediction engine, we will want to rapidly query across both the patient ID and the condition they were evaluated for. By using Delta Lake’s Z-ordering command, we can optimize the table so it can be rapidly queried down either dimension. We have done this on one of our final gold tables, which has joined several of our silver tables together to achieve the data representation we will need for our dashboard</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted"></p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.3-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Now that we've prepared our dataset, we'll build our dashboard allowing us to explore comorbid conditions, or more simply put, conditions that commonly co-occur in a single patient. Some of the time, these can be precursors/risk factors, for example, high blood pressure is a well known risk factor for stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. By discovering and monitoring comorbid conditions, and other health statistics, we can improve care by identifying risks and advising patients on preventative steps they can take. Ultimately, identifying comorbidities is a counting exercise! We need to identify the distinct set of patients who had both condition A and condition B, which means it can be done all fully in SQL using Spark SQL. In our dashboard, we will follow a simple three step process</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">First, we create a dataframe that has conditions, ranked by the number of patients they occurred in. This allows the user to visualize the relative frequency of the most common conditions in their dataset</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.4-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">We then give the user widgets (AWS | Azure) to specify 2 conditions they are interested in comparing. By using Spark SQL, we identify the full set of patients that the condition occurred in</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.5-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Since we do this in Spark SQL using SparkR, we can easily collect the count of patients at the end and use a χ2 test to compute significance. We print whether or not the association between the 2 conditions are statistically significant</p>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted"> While a data scientist who is rapidly iterating to understand what trends lie in their dataset may be happy working in a notebook, we'll encounter a number of users (clinicians, public health officials and researchers, operations analysts, billing analysts) who are less interested in seeing the code underlying the analysis. By using the built-in dashboarding function, we can hide the code and focus on the visualizations we’ve generated. Since we added widgets into our notebook, our users can still provide input to the notebook and change which diseases to compare</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/013.6-full.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">In conclusion, we laid down the fundamentals for building a scalable health data lake with Delta Lake and a simple comorbidity dashboard. To learn more about analyzing real world data at scale</p>
